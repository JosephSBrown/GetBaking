## Get Baking!
The task was to create an interactive website for the Client: Get Baking! The client wanted a website that can demonstrate their aim, a number of recipes, and a blog.

The client requested the Following Colours:
- ![#ff80c4](https://placehold.co/15x15/ff80c4/ff80c4.png) `#ff80c4`
- ![#ffff80](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffff80/ffff80.png) `#ffff80`

However the Client allowed for Variants so the Following Colours were Used:
- ![#f472b6](https://placehold.co/15x15/f472b6/f472b6.png) `#f472b6`
- ![#fef08a](https://placehold.co/15x15/fef08a/fef08a.png) `#fef08a`

Many of the design details were up to developer disgression as long as the colours/variants of the requested colours were obeyed.
